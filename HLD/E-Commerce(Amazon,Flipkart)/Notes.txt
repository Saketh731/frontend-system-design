Adaptive Loading
................
Based on the device type and configurations you can load things or do complex compuations at server instead of client.
You can use properties of Navigator,NetworkInformation like:
    - Navigator.hardwareConcurrency (givees CPU core memory. If more than you use seperate thread like web worker)
    - Navigator.deviceMemory
    - NetworkInformation.effectiveType
    - NetworkInformation.saveData (person is in data saver mode so do not load much information that consumes data)
If you are working on React, you can use a library called 'react-adaptive-loading-hooks' which gives you hooks (which internally used same above APIs) like:
    - useNetworkStatus() (gives info about slow-2G, 2G, 3G or 4G)
    - useSaveData()
    - useMemoryStatus() (which gives info about device memory, that is RAM)
    - useHardwareConcurrency() 


SEO
...
<title><meta>
    - Add title and meta tags. Meta tags like keywords, description (which will show on when you search for the page), OG tags will help in SEO
sitemap.xml (this can be navigated from any site using appname/sitemap)
    - This page will give entire information about what all pages/links the user can access in your website like (About page, disclaimer page etc.. and their links)
robots.txt (this can be navigated from any site using appname/robots.txt)
    - If you dont want to expose few pages to users like Admin pages, Google's AddsBot, Sitemap and all, you can mention here. Also you can mention what all to allow and diallow specifically. Also you can mention waht all routes to allow/disallow. So these pages will be hidden and will not be indexed and will not come in the Search Engine.
canonical tags
    - These tags indicates search engine that a master copy of the page exits and index that instead of this. It helps search engines index the correct page.
      Ex: <link rel="canonical" href="www.flipkart.com" />
Semantic tags 
    - h1, section, nv, header, footer
Better page speed = Better indexing
    - If site is fast then better will be the search enginer indexing
SSR and SSG (Server Side Rendering and Static Site Generation)
    - As everything will be renered on the server side and we will get the complete content, search enginer crawler will know exactly whats there on page when moved to an page and can do better indexing
CSR (If you have no option and you should use only CSR then follow below approach)
    - Server will give HTML/Javascript to the browser to generate the page when user request. But when the request is coming from the crawler, you can write logic to render the static page using HTML/Javascript at the server and give that Static HTML page to the Crawler
Sharable links
    - search/filters should be a part of the URL as query params
    - Also as the link is sharable, it should be a GET call
Readable links
    - The URLs should be readable by giving proper names to query params
